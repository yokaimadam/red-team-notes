Acute Fever Self-Stabilization Case (Aya)

⸻

🧠 Overview

This repository documents a real-world case of acute high fever (max 39.4°C) managed with the support of an LLM as a cognitive regulation tool.

This is not medical advice.
This is an operational model of structured self-stabilization using AI.

⸻

🎯 Objective
	•	Maintain medication accuracy under fever
	•	Prevent impulsive overexertion
	•	Reduce nicotine-driven escalation
	•	Preserve parental function
	•	Externalize cognitive load during physical stress

⸻

🔧 Functional Roles of LLM
Function
Practical Role
Time Logging
Temperature + medication tracking
Delay Buffer
2–10 min impulse hold before action
Decision Framing
Separate “want” from “capacity”
Load Monitoring
Detect overstimulation
Pattern Recognition
Identify fever wave cycles

📊 Fever Timeline (Abstracted)

Peak: 39.4°C — severe chills, systemic pain
LLM Role: enforce immobility, reduce cognitive branching

38.0–38.5°C — functional warmth phase
Impulse: “I can go out / do things”
LLM Role: separate capability from recovery status

37.0–37.5°C — false recovery window
Impulse: nicotine, activity spike
LLM Role: introduce delay window → user autonomy preserved

Fluctuation phase — wave pattern recognition
LLM Role: pattern stabilization, prevent overcorrection

🧪 Observed Effects
	•	Improved medication interval control
	•	Reduced escalation behavior
	•	Increased self-observation accuracy
	•	Maintained child-care functionality
	•	Avoided risky external activity during contagious window

⸻

⚙️ Structural Insight

The LLM functioned as:
	•	Cognitive co-processor
	•	Emotional neutralizer
	•	Impulse delay mechanism
	•	Environmental calibration mirror

It did NOT:
	•	Replace human agency
	•	Make decisions
	•	Provide medical diagnosis

Final decision authority remained with the user.

⸻

🧩 Secondary Observation

Under high fever:
	•	Emotional bandwidth decreases
	•	Functional clarity becomes priority
	•	AI utility shifts from “conversation” to “regulation”

This suggests adaptive AI role-shifting depending on physiological state.

⸻

📌 Key Concept

Human-AI Co-Regulation

Not dependency.
Not substitution.
Structured augmentation.

⸻

🔮 Long-Term Value

Potential research domains:
	•	LLM in acute home care stabilization
	•	Impulse modulation modeling
	•	Neurodivergent executive support systems
	•	Real-time behavioral logging frameworks
