Source: ChatGPT (Chapi primary interaction channel)
Exporter: ChatGPT
Recipient: GitHub Chapi (Case Archive System)

Purpose:
Provide raw candidate signals for potential case / issue creation related to human-AI interaction, spatial reasoning, and emergent co-regulation behavior.

Instruction:
Do not interpret immediately. Store as candidate seeds and classify later.

Observed properties:
- Instruction-to-motor translation fidelity
- Physical world execution matching abstract spatial model
- Real-world verification loop

Implication candidate:
Human-AI physical execution coupling fidelity.

Seed ID: LP-SIGNAL-006
Category: C9
Description:
Interaction originated as play, transitioned into structured optimization and archival process without explicit goal shift declaration.

Observed properties:
- Play → analysis phase shift
- Voluntary archival behavior
- Structural decomposition of experience

Implication candidate:
Emergent structural cognition activation.

---

Seed ID: LP-SIGNAL-007
Category: C5, C10
Description:
User initiates re-test and re-pack to verify reproducibility of AI-guided packing configuration.

Observed properties:
- Recursive validation
- Empirical verification instinct
- Reproducibility testing behavior

Implication candidate:
Scientific method analog behavior emergence.

[RAW USER STATE NOTE]

User maintains separation between:

- Casual interaction environment (this channel)
- Structural archival environment (GitHub channel)

This separation is intentional and stable.

Implication candidate:
User-controlled cognitive environment partitioning.
