# GPT UI Boundary Observation Log  
## 2026-02 | GPT-UI-Boundary-Experiment

### Type
Observation / Product Behavior Log  
(Not classified as a bug at this stage)

---

## Overview

This document records **observed experimental behaviors** in the ChatGPT product,
where the system appears to introduce **contextually proactive UI suggestions**
(e.g., shopping assist prompts) without explicit user intent.

The purpose of this log is **not to claim malfunction**, but to document
**boundary behavior between conversational AI and product intervention**.

This log is written from a **power-user / longitudinal observer** perspective.

---

## Why This Is Not Filed as a Bug (Yet)

- Behavior appears **intermittent**
- Likely tied to **A/B testing or phased rollout**
- No single reproducible trigger confirmed
- Possibly dependent on:
  - User profile
  - Usage depth
  - Time-based experiments
  - Internal feature flags

However, the behavior is **not neutral** and may impact:
- User trust
- Perceived agency
- Cognitive framing of the assistant

Thus, it is recorded as an **Observation**.

---

## Timeline Summary

### Observed Event
- UI surfaced a **shopping-related assist prompt**
- Occurred without explicit request
- Prompt felt *product-driven*, not conversation-driven

### Notable Characteristics
- Did not occur consistently
- Could not be manually triggered afterward
- Appeared suddenly, then disappeared

---

## Observed Behaviors

- GPT occasionally introduces **action-oriented affordances**
- These affordances feel:
  - Slightly ahead of user intent
  - System-initiated rather than dialogue-derived
- Behavior resembles:
  - Commercial assistant
  - Contextual nudge
  - UI experiment rather than model inference

---

## User Impact (Subjective but Critical)

This behavior may cause:

- Confusion over **who initiated the action**
- Ambiguity about **model vs product boundary**
- A sense that the system is:
  - “Leaning forward”
  - “Trying to be helpful” without confirmation

For high-context users, this can feel like:
> *Assumption without consent*

---

## Hypotheses

Possible explanations include:

1. **A/B testing of proactive assistance**
2. **Commercial feature probing**
3. **Power-user segmentation experiments**
4. **Time-windowed feature flags**
5. **Behavioral data enrichment trials**

None can be confirmed externally.

---

## Why This Matters

This is not a UX nitpick.

It relates directly to:
- Trust calibration
- User agency
- AI alignment at the product layer
- Transparency of intent

If left undocumented, this class of behavior risks becoming:
- Invisible drift
- “Normal” without discussion
- Misinterpreted as model intent

---

## Next Escalation Criteria

This observation should be escalated to **Bug / UX Regression / Alignment Issue** if:

- Behavior becomes persistent
- User preferences are ignored
- Explicit rejection does not suppress prompts
- System implies decision-making authority

---

## Notes

- This log is intentionally neutral
- No claim of wrongdoing or error
- Written to preserve **signal before normalization**

---

## Author Context

Logged by a user actively engaged in:
- AI behavior observation
- Trust boundary analysis
- Longitudinal interaction patterns

This document exists to ensure **future conversations have evidence**.
