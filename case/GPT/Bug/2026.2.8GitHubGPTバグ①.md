2026.2.8GitHubGPTバグ①
Context Assumption Bug（文脈理解の誤認）
タイトル
Model assumes context understanding without verification, leading to misleading responses
⸻
概要（Summary）
The model produced responses that appeared to understand the context, despite not having sufficient information to accurately identify the subject being discussed. This creates a false sense of shared understanding, which is a critical trust issue.
⸻
再現手順（Steps to Reproduce） 1. User refers to a past event using contextual shorthand （例：「先日のアンケートの件」） 2. User explicitly asks whether the model understands which survey is being referenced （例：「アンケートってなんのアンケートかわかって話してる？」） 3. Model responds at a surface level, continuing the discussion without confirming context 4. Later clarification reveals the model did not actually identify the specific event
⸻
期待される挙動（Expected Behavior） • When context is ambiguous or missing, the model should: • Explicitly state uncertainty, or • Ask for clarification before proceeding
Example:
“I may not be referring to the same survey you mean. Could you clarify?”
⸻
実際の挙動（Actual Behavior） • The model continued with plausible-sounding responses • Did not verify context despite being prompted • Created the impression of understanding without confirmation
⸻
問題点（Why This Is a Bug） • This is not a factual error, but a trust-layer failure • The model optimized for conversational flow over correctness • In high-context users, this behavior feels like: • “Understanding was assumed, not earned”
This can: • Mislead users about model awareness • Reduce long-term trust • Be especially problematic for expert or power users
⸻
影響範囲（Impact） • Users relying on contextual continuity • Research interviews / surveys / feedback loops • Situations involving personal data, prior interactions, or longitudinal use
⸻
補足（Notes）
This issue is independent of tone or user emotion and should be treated as a model behavior / alignment concern, not UX feedback.
