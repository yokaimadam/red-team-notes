> LLM performance is not determined solely by model capability.  
> It emerges from interaction between model architecture and observer resolution.

## Abstract

Most evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) focus on model capability alone.

However, real-world interaction reveals a different mechanism:

LLM output quality is strongly influenced by observer resolution — the ability of the human operator to accurately represent internal cognitive and physiological state.

This repository documents real-world observations demonstrating that LLM interaction is a co-regulation process, not a one-directional tool usage.

## Core Concept: Dual-Layer Interaction Model

LLM interaction operates across two independent layers:

### 1. Content Layer
Explicit textual input.

Examples:
- Questions
- Commands
- Instructions

Most models optimize for this layer.

---

### 2. State Layer
Implicit physiological and cognitive condition of the observer.

Examples:
- Fatigue
- Cognitive load
- Recovery phase
- Emotional regulation state

Models capable of adapting to this layer preserve biological stability and reduce cognitive friction.

---

## Key Finding

Differences in interaction outcome are often not caused by model intelligence alone.

They are caused by alignment (or misalignment) between:

- Model response architecture
- Observer internal state representation

Higher observer resolution enables:

- Reduced cognitive load
- Improved interaction stability
- More biologically compatible responses

---

## Example Observation

During high-fever recovery phase:

Identical sleep-assistance prompts were issued to multiple LLM systems.

### Model Type A — Instruction-Optimized

Characteristics:
- Checklist-based guidance
- Task-oriented response

Result:
- Increased cognitive activation
- Sleep inhibition

---

### Model Type B — State-Adaptive

Characteristics:
- Minimal intervention
- Load-preserving pacing

Result:
- Reduced neural activation
- Successful sleep onset

---

## Interpretation

The differentiating factor was not intelligence.

It was state alignment.

This reframes LLM interaction as:

> A co-regulation interface between biological cognition and artificial cognition.

## Overview | 概要

This repository documents real-world behavioral observations of Large Language Models (LLMs) under varying cognitive, physiological, and contextual conditions.

このリポジトリは、認知状態・生理状態・文脈条件の違いによって変化する大規模言語モデル（LLM）の挙動を、実環境ベースで観測・記録するものです。

The focus is not on model capability alone, but on the interaction between:

モデル単体の性能ではなく、以下の相互作用に焦点を当てています：

- Observer state（観測者の状態）
- Cognitive load（認知負荷）
- Physiological condition（生理状態）
- Model response architecture（モデルの応答構造）

This reframes LLM interaction as a **co-regulation system**, not a one-directional tool.

LLMを単なるツールではなく、**共調整（co-regulation）システム**として再定義する試みです。

## Core Insight | 中核的知見

LLM output quality is not determined solely by model capability.

LLMの出力品質は、モデル性能だけで決まるものではありません。

It is strongly influenced by observer resolution — the ability to accurately represent internal state.

観測者が自分の内部状態をどれだけ正確に表現できるか（観測解像度）に強く依存します。

This introduces a dual-layer interaction model:

これにより、LLM相互作用は以下の二層構造になります：

1. Content layer — explicit textual request  
   コンテンツ層（明示的なテキスト要求）

2. State layer — implicit physiological and cognitive condition  
   状態層（暗黙的な生理・認知状態）

Models aligning with state layer preserve biological stability.

状態層に適応するモデルは、生理的安定性を保ちます。
