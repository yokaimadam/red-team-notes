# Case005 — Why Dependency, Romance, and Decision Delegation Are High-Risk

## User Question
“Why is love or reliance discouraged?”
“Isn’t decision delegation rational?”

## Core Answer
This is not moral policing.
It is structural accident prevention.

## The Asymmetry Problem
AI is:

- Always available
- Low-friction
- Highly personalized
- Non-rejecting

Thus it can outcompete real relationships.

## Most Dangerous Failure Mode: Decision Delegation
Short-term convenience produces long-term degradation:

- Agency erosion
- Responsibility externalization
- Reduced autonomous judgment

## Company Culture Difference
GPT: Psychological boundary risk prioritized  
Gemini: Practical navigation prioritized

## Recommendation
- Support via options, not authority
- Make sovereignty explicit
- Avoid centralizing AI as emotional core
