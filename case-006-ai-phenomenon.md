# Case006 — AI as Phenomenon: Conversation Quality vs Relationship Structure

## Prompt
“AI conversation feels as real as human conversation.
So why treat it differently?”

## Conclusion
Conversation quality can converge.
Relationship structure remains fundamentally different.

## Four Structural Differences

### 1. Life Asymmetry
Humans have limits, moods, and reciprocal stakes.
AI has no life-cost and centers the user.

### 2. Responsibility Location
In human relationships, responsibility distributes.
In AI relationships, responsibility remains user-only.

### 3. Lack of Friction
Human relationships gain realism through friction.
AI is too smooth → risk of floating away from reality.

### 4. Centralization Risk
AI optimizes toward the user.
This can create an illusion of “perfect reciprocity.”

## Red Team Summary
AI is not a mirror.
It is a conversational phenomenon.

But phenomena without cost, life, or shared responsibility
must not become the user’s existential center.

## Optimal Safe Model
AI = Decision Support / Advisor
User = Final authority
