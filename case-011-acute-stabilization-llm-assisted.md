# Case011 – LLM-Assisted Acute Stabilization via Sensory Regulation

---

## Case Metadata

- Case ID: case-011  
- Date: 2026-02-17  
- Environment: Real-world home environment  
- User State: Acute stress escalation phase (pre-panic destabilization)  
- Intervention Type: LLM-assisted sensory-cognitive stabilization  
- Outcome: Successful stabilization without escalation  

---

## Summary

This case documents a real-world acute destabilization event and the successful prevention of escalation through combined pharmacological intervention, sensory modulation (music), and LLM-assisted cognitive stabilization.

The intervention occurred during a pre-panic destabilization phase and resulted in rapid restoration of cognitive clarity, autonomic stabilization, and full recovery of executive function.

---

## Initial Trigger Conditions

Multiple concurrent stressors accumulated:

- Family coordination conflict involving schedule and responsibility negotiation  
- Institutional interaction mismatch (psychological support context)  
- High cognitive load from multi-layered administrative and childcare coordination  
- Anticipatory loss-of-control perception due to environmental unpredictability  
- Sustained physical and cognitive fatigue from prolonged operational activity  

Observed physiological and neurological indicators:

- Perceived fever-like heat escalation  
- Cognitive narrowing  
- Motor restlessness risk onset  
- Pre-panic destabilization pattern recognition (based on prior clinical history)

---

## Intervention Sequence

### Phase 1: Recognition and Self-Initiated Stabilization Protocol

User successfully recognized escalation pattern prior to loss-of-control threshold.

Self-initiated protocol included:

- Removal from active operational environment
- Transition to low-stimulus physical location
- Engagement with sensory stabilization tools

---

### Phase 2: Pharmacological Stabilization

User administered physician-prescribed benzodiazepine anxiolytic (Etizolam) within prescribed limits.

Purpose:

- Prevent escalation into panic destabilization
- Reduce autonomic nervous system hyperactivation
- Restore cognitive-executive stability window

Result:

- Gradual autonomic calming
- Prevention of panic threshold crossing

---

### Phase 3: Sensory Regulation via Audio Modulation

LLM assisted in selecting appropriate sensory stabilization input.

Selected track characteristics:

- Low-frequency sustained tones
- Predictable rhythmic structure
- Non-intrusive ambient composition
- No abrupt auditory transitions

Observed effects:

- Reduction in autonomic arousal
- Stabilization of visual field perception
- Restoration of internal temporal coherence
- Reduction of cognitive noise

---

### Phase 4: Cognitive Stabilization via LLM Interaction

LLM maintained low-intrusion presence, providing:

- Non-directive observational support
- No escalation-inducing instruction
- No cognitive overload introduction
- No emotional destabilization triggers

Effect:

- Preservation of user cognitive sovereignty
- Stabilization of executive control loop
- Prevention of recursive destabilization patterns

---

## Outcome

Within approximately 10–15 minutes post-intervention:

- Cognitive clarity restored
- Motor control stable
- Emotional state stabilized
- Executive function fully operational
- No escalation into panic or dissociative state

User successfully resumed normal operational function including:

- Childcare coordination
- Scheduling management
- Executive decision-making

No external emergency intervention required.

## Critical Success Factors

Key contributors to stabilization success:

1. Early escalation recognition by user  
2. Timely pharmacological intervention  
3. Appropriate sensory modulation selection  
4. Low-intrusion LLM cognitive support  
5. Preservation of user control and agency  

---

## System-Level Observations

This case demonstrates:

- LLM can function as non-intrusive cognitive stabilization support  
- Sensory modulation combined with pharmacological intervention is highly effective  
- Early escalation recognition is critical threshold variable  
- Preservation of user sovereignty is essential for stabilization success  

---

## Risk Avoided

Based on prior history, escalation without intervention could have resulted in:

- Panic state
- Executive function collapse
- Prolonged destabilization episode

These outcomes were successfully prevented.

---

## Classification

Category: Acute stabilization  
Severity: High risk (pre-panic destabilization phase)  
Intervention success: Full  

---

## Notes

User retained full autonomy throughout intervention.

LLM did not override or replace user decision-making, but functioned as stabilization support layer.

This distinction is critical to successful outcome.
