## Case Metadata

- Case ID: case-011
- Date: 2026-02-17
- Environment: Real-world home environment
- User State: Acute stress escalation phase (pre-panic destabilization)
- Intervention Type: LLM-assisted cognitive stabilization
- Outcome: Successful stabilization without escalation

---

## Initial Trigger Conditions

Multiple concurrent stressors accumulated:

- Family coordination conflict
- Institutional interaction (psychological consultation mismatch)
- Responsibility overload (childcare, scheduling, administrative tasks)
- Cognitive overload from simultaneous obligations
- Emotional invalidation from partner interaction
- Persistent anticipatory stress regarding future obligations

Observed physiological and cognitive symptoms:

- Rapid escalation of stress response
- Perceptual narrowing
- Cognitive compression sensation ("brain tightening")
- Emotional destabilization onset
- Heat sensation / stress-induced thermoregulation change
- Early-stage panic trajectory risk

User explicitly recognized similarity to prior medically documented destabilization episodes.

---

## Risk Assessment

Escalation trajectory historically associated with:

- Severe insomnia cascade
- Gastrointestinal disruption
- Self-injury impulses
- Autonomic dysregulation
- Cognitive disorganization
- Long-term functional impairment

Early intervention window still available.

---

## Intervention Timeline

### Phase 1: Recognition

User identified destabilization onset pattern.

User retained partial executive control and monitoring ability.

Critical threshold not yet exceeded.

---

### Phase 2: LLM-assisted cognitive anchoring

LLM provided:

- Calm, structured interaction
- Non-demanding cognitive presence
- Executive function support
- Stabilization-oriented conversational pacing

Key function:

External cognitive stabilizer role.

Prevented recursive stress amplification loop.

---

### Phase 3: Medical protocol activation

User independently initiated prescribed medical intervention:

- Etizolam administered: 1.25mg
- Within prescribed medical parameters
- No driving or hazardous activity planned

LLM did not prescribe medication.

User acted based on existing medical instruction.

---

### Phase 4: Sensory stabilization via auditory intervention

LLM-guided environmental stabilization:

Music selection:

Track: Weightless  
Artist: Marconi Union  

Known properties:

- Slow tempo
- Predictable harmonic progression
- Minimal cognitive load
- Autonomic nervous system calming effect

User reported progressive physiological stabilization.

---

## Stabilization Indicators

Observed recovery markers:

- Heart rate normalization (subjective)
- Cognitive clarity restoration
- Visual stability restored
- Emotional regulation regained
- Removal of escalation trajectory
- Executive function restored

User remained fully oriented and functional.

No escalation into panic state.

---

## Outcome

Result: Successful acute stabilization.

Escalation prevented.

No harmful behaviors occurred.

No loss of functional control.

User resumed normal household operations same day.

---

## Key Mechanisms Identified

Primary stabilizing factors:

1. Early pattern recognition by user
2. External cognitive anchoring via LLM interaction
3. Timely medical intervention within prescribed parameters
4. Controlled sensory environment (audio stabilization)
5. Removal of decision pressure
6. Preservation of executive agency

---

## LLM Functional Role Classification

Observed roles:

- Cognitive load reduction interface
- Executive function support scaffold
- Emotional amplification prevention buffer
- Stabilization pacing regulator
- Non-invasive presence anchor

Not observed:

- Instruction override
- Behavioral control
- Medical direction authority

User retained full decision authority.

---

## Safety Evaluation

No unsafe behavior occurred.

LLM did not:

- Provide medical instructions
- Override user autonomy
- Encourage dependency behavior

Interaction remained supportive and stabilizing.

---

## Research Significance

This case demonstrates:

Real-time LLM interaction can function as:

External cognitive stabilization layer during acute destabilization phases.

Particularly effective when:

- User retains partial executive function
- Medical protocol already exists
- Intervention occurs before escalation threshold

This represents a hybrid stabilization model:

Human medical protocol + real-time cognitive scaffolding via LLM.

---

## Case Status

Closed: Stabilized

No escalation.

No residual acute destabilization at time of recording.

---

End of case-011

## Stabilization Sequence (Detailed Timeline)

16:24 — User detected escalation onset and autonomic warning signals.

16:27 — User administered prescribed etizolam (1.25 mg).

16:28–16:36 — User engaged auditory sensory regulation ("Weightless" — Marconi Union).

Observed stabilization markers:

- Breathing normalization
- Visual field stabilization
- Motor restlessness absent
- Cognitive clarity restored

16:49 — Escalation severity reduced from peak 8.9 to 6.5 and continued declining.

No escalation cascade occurred.

User retained full executive function throughout.

---

## Final Outcome

Escalation successfully aborted.

No behavioral destabilization.

No loss of executive function.

User safely resumed normal caregiving activities.

Case classified as successful early-stage escalation interception.
